# Imager

Imager is a social network where users can upload photos, create albums, and follow other users. The site was built with the Python Django framework during the Code Fellows Development Accelerator by [James Warren](http://www.github.com/jwarren116) and [Nick Becker](http://www.github.com/nbeck90). You can view the Imager site [here](http://ec2-52-10-250-82.us-west-2.compute.amazonaws.com).
